[@subject: Handling datums from different origins]

* suppose you have an EPS for the same stock and year from different origins (e.g. web sites)
* that could happen frequently for estimated values

* think about a strategy to handle this scenario
  * select by timestamp? provider ranking?, average?
* there is already s.th. available in Maui.Entities.Dynamics.xml
  * clean that up
