- how to mark a year of stock prices as "valid"
  - what is valid? do we need a calendar?
  - or do we say if we got the year/month at once via historical prices it is valid?
  - can we apply some heuristics? (3 times same value = error?, 5 days no value == error?)
- how to mark it technically?
  - mark the single price itself?
  - use some kind of hash?
  - read s.th. about it in the net!
