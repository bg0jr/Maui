[@subject: Mark data as "readonly"]

- we have a lot of different data in the database
- we do a lot automatically
- it is easy that we overwrite data which has been "confirmed" by the user

- add support for marking data as "readonly" or "confirmed"
- or do we use "DatumValidity"?
- how do we handle it for series? (stock prices)
