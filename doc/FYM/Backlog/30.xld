[@subject: Maui.Tools.DatumLocatorValidator]

- we just add new sites to a DatumLocator when ever we find s.th. not working
- we should also have a tool to validate existing sites whether those still work
- we could work with pre-defined set of stocks
- fetch real data from the web and validate results
- goal: cleanup DatumLocators, validate DatumLocators before using them in production usecase
