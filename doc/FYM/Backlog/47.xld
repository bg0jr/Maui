[@subject: Additional links on SystemReport]

- Maui.Trading.Reporting
- add link to ariva and onvista technical analysis
- add link to MauiWiki (search? or should we have RESTful services to MauiWiki? 
  /stock/<isin>
- should we have an AdditionalReportGenerator? or do we want to have a direct 
  link? AdditionalReport would have the benefit that we could add more additional 
  links (e.g. to wiki)
