[@subject: ShortCut to watch maui.log]

- it is still often required to check maui log
- lets have some kind of shortcut to start the logviewer
- doskey in devshell?
- batch file?
- should we integrate the logviewer exe in maui package?: yes
  - package should always work without dependencies to other HG repositories
