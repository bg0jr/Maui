[@subject: Signal handling of the IndicatorSection]

- Maui.Trading.Reporting
- On the indicators section we display weighted signals at the moment. 
- is this the way we want it to be? basically it is correct but do we also want to see the raw
  indicator signal? or is it enough to have it on the details report?
- maybe both?
