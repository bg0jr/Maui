! Starter Hooks

- actually the starter and the hooks are just a Workflow inwoker and WF activities
- in the simples case a WF is just one activity
- we would need an activity to host scripts (how could we do this without deriving from Activity?, but still keep the 
  possiblity to define scripts in xaml? incl. properties)

Decision: keep light-weight-xaml-scripting approach for now until we discover major necessary improvements which give a reason to switch to WF.
Actually we do not want to have komplext scripting in starter hooks ...
