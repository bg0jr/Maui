[@subject: Refactoring - DataProviderSC]

- it is not a SC actually
- maybe it is a kind of factory but also others are creating GenericDatumProvider manually

- Define how it should be used in future
- Should it be like AlgoBC? get a algo (provider) and work directly with it?
- should it be like SceneGraphSC: put work package into it and get results?
- both ideas can work with async stuff

- document the decision and the new design
- cleanup the code
