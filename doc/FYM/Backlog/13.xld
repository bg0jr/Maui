* The "user inbox" is a possiblity of the user to see what happened in the system (mainly through batch processing).
* The system adds messages whenever changes happened on the "basis"
  * e.g. newly added companies, sectors, aliases, etc 
* inbox is visible in studio and messages can be marked as read
* only last 100 messages are kept, rest is deleted (if already read!)
